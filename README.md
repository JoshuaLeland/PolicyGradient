# PolicyGradient

Followed Berkley Deep RL class here: http://rail.eecs.berkeley.edu/deeprlcourse/ 

Just updated normalizing the baselines.

Next weekend when I have time I will add cuda in.

I noticed some of the gym values have multiple output touples, so I want to add support to for that in the future.

Policy Gradient is a lot more chaotic than I originally would have expected.  This has been a good learning experiance.

Soon I will try and build Actor/Critic or Deep Q.
